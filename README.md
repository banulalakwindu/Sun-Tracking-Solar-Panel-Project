# Sun-Tracking-Solar-Panel-Project
Sun-Tracking Solar Panel optimizes energy absorption by dynamically adjusting orientation using Arduino and AVR codes. Addressing Earth's rotation, it enhances efficiency through real-time light intensity measurements with a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and servo motor control. Explore presentation slides and codes for details.
