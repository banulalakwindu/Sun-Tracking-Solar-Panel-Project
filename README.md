# Sun-Tracking Solar Panel Project 🌞🔧

## Introduction

The Sun-Tracking Solar Panel project 🌞🔧 was developed as a part of the University Embedded Systems Subject. With the increasing demand for renewable energy sources, the project aims to enhance the efficiency of solar panels by implementing an automated sun-tracking system.

## Problem Statement

One of the challenges with traditional solar panels is their inability to adjust to the changing position of the sun throughout the day due to the Earth's rotation 🌍🔄. This leads to suboptimal exposure to sunlight, resulting in lower energy absorption efficiency.

## Solution

The solution presented in this project involves the implementation of a sun-tracking system. By monitoring sunlight using a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and adjusting the solar panel's position with a servo motor, the system optimizes the absorption of solar energy ☀️🔄.

## Scope

The primary scope of the project is to maximize sunlight absorption by dynamically adjusting the solar panel's orientation based on real-time light intensity measurements 📏🌞. The system achieves this through the integration of Arduino and AVR codes.
